# Car_Racing
Creating a simulation where car learns to drive using RL + DQN approach to minimize the collisions.

Here I've implemented DQN using the current neural network and target neural network,explored the drawbacks of Q-learning and how DQN is beneficial especially in RL where there're large number of states.In order to understand this explored many resources and got to learn about new things.

1.Reinforcement_Learning contains the main logic of the DQN and how it's used to take the actions
</br>
2.Car_spec contains the basic math and configuration.

Many articles helped better understand RL and it's implementation.</br>
