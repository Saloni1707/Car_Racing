# Car_Racing
Creating a simulation where car learns to drive using RL + DQN approach to minimize the collisions.

Here I've implemented DQN using the current neural network along with the target neural network,explored the drawbacks of Q-learning and how DQN is beneficial especially in RL where there're large number of states.In order to understand this explored many resources and got to learn about new things.

This yt video helped me alot in order to understand DQN -> https://youtu.be/EUrWGTCGzlA?si=VU-DjBWJzQDDJTAg
